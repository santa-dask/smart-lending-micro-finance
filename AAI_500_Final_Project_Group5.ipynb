        "\n",
        "A Loan Eligibility Calculator for Small and Micro Businesses in India\n",
        "\n",
        "**Problem Statement:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Despite the crucial role of small and micro businesses (SMBs) in India's economy, accessing loans remains a significant challenge due to the lack of a standardized and efficient loan eligibility assessment process. This often results in inconsistent decision-making, delays in loan disbursement, and missed opportunities for SMBs.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why is this problem important?**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Inefficient Decision Making:** Traditional loan assessment methods can be subjective and time-consuming, leading to inconsistent decisions that may not accurately reflect the true creditworthiness of SMBs.\n",
        "2. **Delayed Loan Disbursement:** The manual process of loan assessment can create delays in loan disbursement, hindering the growth and expansion of SMBs.\n",
        "3. **Missed Opportunities:** SMBs may lose valuable business opportunities due to the inability to access timely financing.\n",
        "4. **Financial Exclusion:** Many SMBs, especially those in rural areas or with limited financial literacy, may be excluded from the formal financial system due to complex loan application processes.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Proposed Solution:**\n",
        "\n",
        "A loan eligibility calculator, specifically designed for Indian SMBs, can address these challenges by providing a standardized, data-driven, and efficient tool for assessing loan applications. This calculator would leverage various factors such as customer profile, business performance, social media presence, revenue, and credit score to determine the likelihood of loan repayment. By automating the assessment process, the calculator can streamline the loan application process, reduce decision-making time, and improve access to finance for SMBs.\n",
